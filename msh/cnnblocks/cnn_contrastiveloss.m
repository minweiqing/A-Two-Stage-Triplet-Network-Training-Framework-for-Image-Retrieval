function [y] = cnn_contrastiveloss(x, label, m, dzdy)
% CNN_CONTRASTIVELOSS computes triplet loss for each query in a batch:
%   NQ query tuples, each packed in the form of (q,p,n1,..nN)
%
%   Y = cnn_contrastiveloss(X, L, M) computes contrastive loss with margin M, for vectors X with labels L.
%     For a pair (i, j) contrastive loss is:
%     Y(i,j) = L(i,j) * L2DIST(X(:,:,:,i), X(:,:,:,j))^2 / 2 + (1 - L(i,j)) * MAX(0, M - L2DIST(X(:,:,:,i), X(:,:,:,j)))^2 / 2
%
%   X has dimension 1 x 1 x D x N packing N vectors with D-dimensions. L has dimension 1 x N.
%   L has value -1 for each query image, each query is followed by 1 for positive and 0 for negative images.
%
%   DZDX = cnn_contrastiveloss(X, L, M, DZDY) computes the derivative of the block
%   projected onto DZDY. DZDX and DZDY have the same dimensions as X and Y respectively.
